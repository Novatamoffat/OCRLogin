# OCRLogin

This Python script automates the login process for a web application that requires a verification code (captcha). It utilizes Selenium for web automation and ddddocr for optical character recognition (OCR) to read the captcha. The script captures the captcha image, processes it, and attempts to log in with a username and passwords from a file, retrying if necessary. This makes it a useful tool for automating the login process in scenarios where captcha verification is required.
